# Hello, Translate!

This is the code project for the [Hello, Translate!](https://davidpallmann.hashnode.dev/hello-translate) blog post. 

This episode: Amazon Translate and Neural Machine Translation. In this Hello, Cloud blog series, we're covering the basics of AWS cloud services for newcomers who are .NET developers. If you love C# but are new to AWS, or to this particular service, this should give you a jumpstart.

In this post we'll introduce Amazon Translate and use it in a "Hello, Cloud" .NET program to perform language translation. We'll do this step-by-step, making no assumptions other than familiarity with C# and Visual Studio. We're using Visual Studio 2022 and .NET 6.

## Our Hello, Translate Project

After getting familiar with Amazon Translate in the AWS Console, you'll write a .NET 6 program that invokes Translate to translate text files from and to any supported language. We'll first do this in real-time, then see how to translate documents with a batch job.

See the blog post for the tutorial to create this project and run it on AWS.
